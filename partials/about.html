            <h1>What is EpiCore?</h1>

            <p>
                EpiCore is a project that draws on the knowledge and skills of trained health professionals around the world to verify outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases using innovative surveillance methods that can help find outbreaks faster than traditional methods.
            </p>

            <p>
                A partnership between the <a href="http://www.skollglobalthreats.org/" target="_blank">Skoll Global Threats Funds</a>, <a href="http://www.healthmap.org/" target="_blank">HealthMap</a>, <a href="http://promedmail.org/" target="_blank">ProMED-mail</a>, and <a href="http://www.tephinet.org/" target="_blank">TEPHINET</a>, EpiCore creates a virtual community through its moderated digital platform that provides online training, allows resource sharing, and facilitates communication between EpiCore members in order to improve outbreak detection around the world.
            </p>

            <h4>What are the responsibilities of an EpiCore member?</h4>

            <p>
                EpiCore members are volunteers who respond to occasional “Requests for Information” or “RFIs” sent via e-mail. These “requests for information” or “RFIs” are sent by a team of emerging disease specialists trained to recognize outbreaks of public health significance, often based on informal sources that require further verification. Currently, these specialists are represented by more than 35 ProMED-mail moderators from around the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Moderators send RFIs targeted to the geographic area of a reported outbreak and provide as much information as available to help establish the nature of the outbreak.
            </p>

            <p>
                As an EpiCore member, you will receive RFIs pertaining to your geographical location and can communicate with the moderator to help verify an outbreak. It is important to note that the platform is set up in such a way that your identity is not revealed to the moderator when you submit a response, and is anonymous by default unless you choose to reveal your identity in your response.
            </p>

            <h4>How should I gather information for an RFI response?</h4>
            <p>
                You are not expected to actively investigate outbreaks, but try to gather as much specific information as possible. Here are some examples of common ways to gather reportable information:
            </p>

            <ul style="padding-left:40px">
                <li>Previous knowledge (something known)</li>
                <li>Phone a friend</li>
                <li>Check local / print media (newspapers, radio, TV, etc.)</li>
                <li>Check official reports</li>
                <li>Go back to the original source</li>
                <li>Call hospital / clinic / health center</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>

            <h4>What type of information should be provided in an RFI response?</h4>
            <p>
                Here are some examples on the type of information that should be gathered:
            </p>

            <ul style="padding-left:40px">Person:
                <li>Demographics (age, gender, etc.)</li>
                <li>Case numbers</li>
                <li>Fatalities</li>
                <li>Lab results</li>
                <li>Diagnosis</li>
                <li>Pathogen</li>
                <li>Supporting information</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <ul style="padding-left:40px">Place:
                <li>Location of patient(s)</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <ul style="padding-left:40px">Time:
                <li>Date of occurrence(s)</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                <i>Remember! Some information is better than no information, so we encourage you to submit as much as you can!</i>
            </p>

            <h4>How will the EpiCore project help?</h4>

            <p>
                The EpiCore project aims to speed the recognition, validation and reporting of outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases using innovative surveillance that complements the traditional surveillance process.
                Once you submit your response, the requesting moderator will evaluate it along with any other responses received from other EpiCore members, assess the content and credibility of each response, and then share them with ProMED-mail’s readers, providing prompt, complete and transparent updates on outbreaks of interest that can in turn help shift the outbreak detection and reporting paradigm.
            </p>

            <h4>Who can apply? </h4>

            <p>
                Members of EpiCore should have a degree in the human / animal health field (human or veterinary medicine, nursing, microbiology or a similar field), plus knowledge of the basic principles of epidemiology, infectious disease, and/or related fields.
            </p>

            <ul style="padding-left:40px">EpiCore members must have at least 2 of the following qualifications:
                <li>An advanced degree in Public Health or a related field (e.g. MPH)</li>
                <li>Health profession certification or licensure (e.g. MD, DVM, RN)</li>
                <li>3-5 years of experience in human or animal health</li>
                <li>Current affiliation with a medical center, university, Ministry/Department of Health, or other health-related organization including NGOs & private sector organizations</li>
                <li>Successful completion of a field epidemiology training program</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>

            <h4>What should I expect after I apply?</h4>

            <p>
                Each application will be evaluated, and those who meet the minimum requirements will be notified of their acceptance. Shortly after you are accepted, you will receive a brief, specialized on-line training on innovative surveillance, a key contributor to global 21st century disease detection efforts, and the use of the epicore.org platform.
            </p>

            <p>
                After successfully completing the training, you will become a member of the EpiCore community and begin receiving RFIs to verify disease outbreaks in your geographic area.
            </p>
