        <p>The information included has been verified by EPICORE, a network with a world-wide distribution of public health professionals ensuring a large spectrum of verification activities in proximity to where events are reported.
            EPICORE members give highest priority to reliable sources of information including direct/indirect documentation about events, official statements and complementary reliable reports obtained at local level. Despite this,
            EPICORE does not aim to replace any official reporting system and is meant to be a complementary surveillance tool supporting public health actors in their activities.
            For all these reasons please consider that this information does not represent an official report and contents included should not be qualified as “officially verified”.
