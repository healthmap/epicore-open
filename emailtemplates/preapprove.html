    <p style="margin:12px 0;"> Dear  [NAME], <br><br>

        The moment we've been waiting for is here! We are thrilled to inform you the EpiCore project is officially launched as of today!
        And it is our pleasure to inform you that based on your credentials that were reviewed by our panel, you have been accepted as a pioneer member of EpiCore.<br><br>

        Your username to use the platform at www.epicore.org is your email address where you are receiving this email.
        Please use the following link to login and set your password: <a href="[LINK]"> Login</a> <br><br>

        You will now begin receiving RFIs about possible outbreaks in your region.<br><br>

        As a refresher from your training, examples of the types of information that you should try to provide in an RFI response include
        <b>person</b> (such as demographics (age, gender, etc.),case numbers, fatalities, lab results, diagnosis, pathogen,
        and any other supporting information), <b>location</b> of patient(s), and <b>date</b> of occurrence(s), which you can gather from
        information you already know, or by phoning a friend, checking local / print media (newspapers, radio, TV, etc.),
        checking official reports, going back to the original source and/or calling the hospital / clinic / health center.<br><br>

        <i><b>Remember! Some information is better than no information, so we encourage you to submit as much as you can!</b></i><br><br>

        We are very excited to begin working with you to change the landscape of disease outbreak detection! <br><br>
        If you have any questions about this project, please do not hesitate to contact us at info@epicore.org.<br><br>

        Sincerely,<br>
        The EpiCore Team</p>
