    <p style="margin:0 0 24px 0;">Dear  [NAME],</p>
    
    <p style="margin:0 0 24px 0;">You are now a member of EpiCore! You can now use your email address and password to <a href="[LINK]" style="text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold;color:#3fc8c8;">login</a> to the platform and begin responding to outbreak Requests for Information (RFIs). You will also begin receiving emails for any RFIs from moderators about any outbreaks in your region, so please check your email regularly.</p>    

<p style="margin:0 0 24px 0;">Our records indicate that you have finished the online training on innovative surveillance and the use of the EpiCore.</p>

    <p style="margin:0 0 24px 0;">You can now log in to the platform on www.epicore.org using the username and password you have previously set up, and will now begin receiving RFIs about possible outbreaks in your region.</p>

    <p style="margin:0 0 24px 0;">As a refresher from your training, examples of the types of information that you should try to provide in an RFI response include <b>person</b> (such as demographics (age, gender, etc.),case numbers, fatalities, lab results, diagnosis, pathogen, and any other supporting information), <b>location</b> of patient(s), and <b>date</b> of occurrence(s), which you can gather from information you already know, or by phoning a friend, checking local / print media (newspapers, radio, TV, etc.), checking official reports, going back to the original source and/or calling the hospital / clinic / health center.</p>

        <p style="margin:0 0 24px 0;font-weight:bold;">Remember! Some information is better than no information, so we encourage you to submit as much as you can!</p>

        <p style="margin:0 0 24px 0;">We are very excited to begin working with you to change the landscape of disease outbreak detection!</p>

        <p style="margin:0 0 24px 0;">If you have any questions about this project, please do not hesitate to contact us at info@epicore.org.</p>

    <p style="margin:0 0 24px 0;">Sincerely,<br>
        The EpiCore Team</p>
